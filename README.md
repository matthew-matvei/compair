# Compair

An extensible yet simple to use tool for comparing anything.

## Quick look

To compare anything using this program, simply create a subject

Edit the criteria according to which you will compare this subject

Then, add instances of the subject to compare

## Contributing

This application is GNU licensed, so feel free to share. Main requests
for contribution would be:

* Sorting Algorithm - the app uses a very unresearched method of sorting
    instances according to direction and priority, based purely on my
    gut feeling
* Tidying up dialogs - some repetitive may be reduced
