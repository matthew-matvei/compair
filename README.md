# Compair

An extensible yet simple to use tool for comparing anything.

## Getting started

This app is currently only available by getting it *from the source*.

    > git clone https://github.com/matthew-matvei/compair.git
    > cd compair
    > npm install

Then to build it:

    > npm run build

## Testing

    > npm test

## Contributing

This application is GNU licensed, so feel free to share. Main requests
for contribution would be:

* Aesthetic Design - it's currently the strappiest of Bootstraps
* Sorting Algorithm - the app uses a very unresearched method of sorting
    instances according to direction and priority, based purely on my
    gut feeling
* Tidying up dialogs - some repetitive code exists
